Our lab focuses on bridging the gap between genotypes and phenotypes. At a broader scale, we are keen to integrate various large-scale biological datasets such as phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics data and functional annotations to boost the power of **Genome-wide Association Study** and **Genomic Selection**.

Our lab's major interests (see [research page](/research/) for more details) include:  
 - Using **quantitative and population genetics** approaches to understand the genetic architecture of agronomically important traits, and how **deleterious alleles** shape the patterns of plant adaptation.  
 - Exploring the **genetic basis of heterosis** and predicting hybrid performance by incorporating biological annotation information.  
 - **Collecting and modeling complex phenotypes**, such as molecular phenotypes, time series phenotypes, or phenotypes obtained via image analyses, and understanding the molecular mechanism controlling for plant development.  

If you are interested in any of the above topics, read more about [how to join the lab](/positions).

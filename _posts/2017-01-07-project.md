As computational/statistical researchers, we often found ourselves had a hard in finding data, codes or related notes.
From several years of research experience, I experimented many note-taking and project management tools. Among those, I found the following practices are the most efficient and productive ones.

## Git controlled

Of course, it should be git controlled and better to be put on [Github](https://github.com/yangjl). Git enables us to work collaboratively and to track any changes from anybody. I would suggest all my coworkers put their research codes on github.

To store data, especially large data sets, I would suggest put them in shared data folders among lab members and put a symbolic link in your current project. Or creat a `largedata` folder in your current project and `.gitignore` the folder.
Github offers a handy collection of [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) files, some of which are global and can be added to your [global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/), and others which are project specific.

### Commit Messages

Use informative commit messages.  
Read the following suggestions:  
1. [How to write a git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)  
2. [On commit messages](http://who-t.blogspot.de/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)  

## Project Directory Architecture

In a typical `R` project, I will copy the following folder into the project dir.
The layout of directories is based on the idea from [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/architecture.html).

1. **cache**: Here we store intermediate data sets that are generated during preprocessing steps.
2. **data**: Here we store our raw data of small size.
Data of large size, i.e. > 100M, store in a `largedata` folder that has been ignored using `.gitignore`.
3. **doc**: Documentation codes (i.e. Rmd files) for generating the figures.
4. **graphs**: Graphs produced during the analysis.
5. **lib**: Some functions used within this project.
6. **munge**: Here we store some preprocessing or data munging codes.
7. **profilling**: Main scripts for the project. It contains some sub-directories.
8. **TODO**: A todo list, markdown file.
9. **README**: readme file.

## Numbering system for codes ordering

To manage research codes, I employ a numbering system.
As shown in the below example from one of my research projects, I have multiple subfolders in the `profilling` folder. Codes were named by number, letter and other numbers separated with dots. My research was conducted according the order, i.e. I processed phenotypic traits using `1.A.0_pheno_trait.R` and then plotted the data using `1.A.1_pheno_plot.R`. It will always easier for me to go back to re-visit some of the codes or re-plot the figures with this numbering and codes ordering system.

## Research Goals 

You should include a slide (or multiple slides if necessary) to explain your 
  - overall goals 
  - what you did

If there are pictures or schematics, include them. These slides can be recycled every week. Modify them if necessary.

## Research slides

Slides should include results. For example:
- Data (graphs)
- Images of "things" analyzed (if appropriate)
- Details on how measurement was performed 

There may be multiple results slides, both for individual data sets as well as statistical analysis across data sets.


## Last slide

The last slide should outline:

- To Do list
  - Your next steps
  - Any key hurdles --- however small or large
  
- Other plans:
  - Any questions you have not related to your research
  - Course questions
  - Any upcoming vacations

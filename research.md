### Rescuing fixed deleterious alleles through genomic selection

During the long-term improvement processes in maize, large numbers of deleterious alleles (or bad alleles) have been accumulated and fixed in the elite maize lines by chance, creating obstacles for further crop improvement. 
Fortunately, a portion of the fixed bad alleles are still segregating in traditional cultivated landraces, which provides opportunities to rescue these fixed bad alleles and to enrich the diversity of the germplasm pool for breeding. 
It will take years, however, to adapt the open pollinated landraces, mainly grown in the tropical areas of the world, to the U.S. corn belt environments. The USDA-ARS [GEM (Germplasm Enhancement of Maize)](https://usda-gem.public.iastate.edu/GEM_Project/GEM_Project.htm) project has brought some of the exotic alleles into temperate lines since 1994. 
In the Yang lab, we will identify the alternative alleles using publicly available GEM lines and evaluate their phenotypic consequences, emphasizing on the micronutrient composition (collaborating with [Waters research lab](https://agronomy.unl.edu/waters-research-lab) at UNL) and yield related traits.
Eventually, we will develop genomic selection protocols in collaboration with [the Cheng Lab](http://qtl.rocks/) at UC Davis to facilitate the rescuing process.

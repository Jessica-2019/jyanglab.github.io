Our resesarch focuses on bridging the gap between genotypes and phenotypes. At a broader scale, we are keen to integrate various large-scale biological data sets such as phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics data and functional annotations to boost the power of **Genome-wide Association Study** and **Genomic Selection**.

Our lab's major interests include:  
 - Using **quantitative and population genetics** approaches to understand the genetic architecture of  agronomically important traits  
 - Exploring the **genetic basis of heterosis** and predicting hybrid performance by incorporating biological annotation information  
 - **Collecting and modeling complex phentoypes**, such as molecular phenotypes, time series phenotypes, or phenotypes obtained via image analyses

Inspired by [R.E.H.A.B.](), as well as its fellow journal clubs including [C.A.M.P.](), [E.H.R.A.B.](), [Detox](), etc., we assemble an informal journal club to share ideas regarding recent papers or preprints. We focus on, but not limited to, quantitative genetics/genomics in all aspects.

We meet every Friday at 4 pm at the *location*.

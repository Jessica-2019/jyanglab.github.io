Inspired by [R.E.H.A.B.](http://www.rilab.org/rehab.html), as well as its fellow journal clubs including [EvolFri](http://evolfri.blogspot.com/), [C.A.M.P.](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mhufford/HuffordLab/camp/camp.html), [E.H.R.A.B.](http://hagenetics.org/?cat=6), [Detox](http://beissingerlab.org/Detox/), etc., we assemble an informal journal club at UNL to share ideas regarding recent papers or preprints of interest. We focus on, but not limited to, **QU**antitative genetics and genomics, bio-**I**nformatics and breeding **T**echnologies in all aspects.

Anyone is welcome to suggest a paper (by sending an email to _jinliang.yang at unl.edu_) and come to talk with us. Nobody will present or defend the papers. We directly jump right into discussion with the assumption that you have read the paper.
There is no email list; articles are posted below along with the date.

We meet every **Friday at 4:30 pm in the Goodding Learning Center**, located in 280 Plant Sciences Hall on East Campus at UNL.
